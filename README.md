🧠 Project Explanation
I developed a Spring Boot REST API for managing books using a clean three-tier architecture by clearly separating the Controller, Service, and Repository layers. This ensured modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
To make the API professional and developer-friendly, I implemented a generic response wrapper using ResponseEntity to standardize JSON responses and accurately handle HTTP status codes in a REST-compliant manner.
For database persistence, I integrated Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL, leveraging Hibernate for ORM functionality. The complete API lifecycle — including CRUD operations, validation, and error handling — was thoroughly tested using Postman.
This project strengthened my understanding of RESTful API design, layered architecture principles, and production-level backend development practices.
